Async FIFO, or Asynchronous FIFO, is a FIFO buffer where the read and write operations are controlled by independent clock domains. This means that the writing process and the reading process are driven by different clocks, which are not synchronized. Async FIFOs are used to safely transfer data between these asynchronous clock domains.
