Async FIFO, or Asynchronous FIFO, is a FIFO buffer where the read and write operations are controlled by independent clock domains. This means that the writing process and the reading process are driven by different clocks, which are not synchronized. Async FIFOs are used to safely transfer data between these asynchronous clock domains.
In an asynchronous FIFO, the read and write operations are managed by separate clock domains. The write pointer always points to the next word to be written. On a FIFO-write operation, the memory location pointed to by the write pointer is written, and then the write pointer is incremented to point to the next location to be written. Similarly, the read pointer always points to the current FIFO word to be read. On reset, both pointers are set to zero. When the first data word is written to the FIFO, the write pointer increments, the empty flag is cleared, and the read pointer, which is still addressing the contents of the first FIFO memory word, immediately drives that first valid word onto the FIFO data output port to be read by the receiver logic. The FIFO is empty when the read and write pointers are both equal, and it is full when the write pointer has wrapped around and caught up to the read pointer.
